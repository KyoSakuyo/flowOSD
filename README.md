## About

flowOSD - is an open source application to control hardware and show OSD messages on [ASUS ROG Flow x13](https://rog.asus.com/laptops/rog-flow/2021-rog-flow-x13-series/) notebooks. 

This app is designed to provide you with a streamlined driver-only experience for your ASUS ROG Flow x13 device. Unlike other ASUS utilities, such as MyASUS and Armoury Crate, this app only requires the installation of drivers to function properly. This means that you can avoid installing unnecessary software and keep your device running smoothly and efficiently.

I created this app for my own use and would be delighted if others found it helpful too. I designed it to be a useful tool for customizing and optimizing ASUS devices without the need for extra software or utilities.

This app is tested on **GV301QH** model (120Hz WUXGA display). The proper functionality with other modifications are not guaranteed. 

Dark and light themes are supported:

## Features

### Performance

flowOSD gives you the power to control important settings on your device, including CPU boost mode, performance modes, and system power modes. With this app, you can easily adjust these settings to optimize your device's performance and battery life according to your specific needs. Whether you're looking to increase your device's processing power for demanding tasks like gaming and video editing, or conserve battery power when you're on the go, this app has you covered. By putting the control in your hands, this app empowers you to get the most out of your device's performance and battery life.

Also this app gives you the ability to limit the CPU power and set custom fan curves. With this added functionality, you can fine-tune your device's performance and cooling to your exact specifications. By limiting the CPU power, you can reduce energy consumption and heat output, which can improve your device's battery life and prevent overheating. Additionally, setting custom fan curves allows you to optimize your device's cooling performance, ensuring that it stays cool and quiet even during demanding tasks. With these advanced features, this app puts you in complete control of your device's performance, energy consumption, and cooling, allowing you to get the most out of your device without compromising on stability or reliability.

### Display

This app provides you with the ability to automatically change your display's refresh rate based on the power source your device is connected to. This feature allows you to optimize your device's performance and battery life whether you're using it plugged in or on the go.

When your device is plugged in, the app can automatically increase the refresh rate to provide a smoother and more fluid viewing experience, particularly when watching videos or playing games with high frame rates. This allows you to enjoy the best possible viewing experience while your device is connected to a power source.

When your device is on battery power, the app can automatically decrease the refresh rate to conserve battery life. This can help extend the overall lifespan of your device's battery and ensure that you can use your device for longer periods of time between charges.

With this feature, you don't have to worry about manually adjusting your display's refresh rate every time you switch between power sources.

### GPU

flowOSD provides the ability to control the state of your discrete GPU. This can help optimize your device's performance and battery life, as the discrete GPU consumes more power than the integrated graphics. By controlling the state of the discrete GPU, you can ensure that you get the best performance and battery life possible, without sacrificing stability or reliability.

### Keyboard

flowOSD provides you with the ability to fully customize your keyboard backlight timeout and hotkeys. With this feature, you can adjust the length of time that your keyboard backlight stays on, which can help conserve battery life and reduce eyestrain in low-light conditions. You can also assign custom hotkeys to specific functions, allowing you to quickly access your favorite features with just a press of a button.

### Battery

flowOSD offers two important features to optimize your device's battery life. The first feature is the ability to limit the battery charge, which can help prolong the overall lifespan of your battery. By setting a limit on the battery charge level, you can prevent the battery from overcharging, which can cause it to degrade and lose its capacity over time. With this feature, you can ensure that your battery remains healthy and lasts as long as possible.

The second feature of this app is that it shows you detailed battery information, including the current charge rate and wear percentage. This information can help you keep track of your battery's health and performance over time, allowing you to make informed decisions about how you use your device and when to replace your battery.

### Notifications

flowOSD provides you with a convenient way to stay informed about your device's hardware events. With this app, most hardware events are highlighted with on-screen display (OSD) messages, which pop up on your screen to notify you of important events such as changes in keyboard backlight, display, performance or power state. You can also configure the app to show notifications for specific events, allowing you to customize your notification settings according to your preferences.

With these OSD messages and customizable notifications, you can stay up-to-date on important hardware events without having to constantly check your device's settings or status.
